      <description>In SDS 348, we have been working on using python for the last two weeks of the semester in order to do our final project. During these two weeks we’ve went over the basics of python such as how to create a python file in R studio using touch newfile.py and playing around with simple commands such as:
3-2 ## 1 3+2 ## 5 3*2 ## 6 3**2 ## 9 pow(3,2) ## 9 3%2  ## 1 3/2 ## 1 3.</description>

0.) Introduction: For this project, I have chosen to look at stats from the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 NBA season because I was interested in comparing player stats from both seasons. The 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 seaons were chosen since they were the two most recent full seasons played. The variables contained in both datasets include player, position, and age among 26 other variables. The data for this project was acquired from basketball-reference.</description>

Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
