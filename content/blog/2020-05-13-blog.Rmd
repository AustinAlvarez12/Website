In SDS 348, we have been working on using python for the last two weeks of the semester in order to do our final project. During these two weeks we've went over the basics of python such as how to create a python file in R studio using touch newfile.py and playing around with simple commands such as:
```{python}
3-2
3+2
3*2
3**2
pow(3,2)
3%2 
3/2
3.0/2 
3//2 
```
Being able to execute basic code such as this has given me a foundation to build upon and allowed me to do the homework and quizzes that were assigned in that period. For example, in one of my homework problems I had to excute this command:
```{python}
fruit_prices = {
'apple': 0.65,
'mango': 1.50,
'strawberry': '$3/lb',
'musk melon': 'unavailable'
}

fruit_prices['mango']
```
The purpose of executing this command on the homework was to set a price for mango then look up the price for mango by put the name mango in the fruit_prices function. The value obtained by this command was 1.5 which is equal to the value assigned for mango. The homework, quizzes, and Power Point slides for python have gone to greatly help me do the final project that requires using python!
